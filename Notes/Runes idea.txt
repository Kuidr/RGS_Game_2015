spellcodes -> runecodes

- Use crystals to craft runes. 
- You have a collection of up to 8 runes, mapped
  to right joystick directions. 
- Using a rune costs nothing.
- If a rune creates a projectile, the rune remains in the collection
  until the projectile is destroyed.
- Can break runes in one's collection (to free up space) by pointing with 
  the right joystick and pressing a button. It takes a couple seconds for a
  rune to break, preventing easy denying of projectiles. Replaces dispel spell.
- The rune list shows which runes can currently be crafted in the cave. When a player
  crafts a rune, the rune is removed from the list, and a new rune replaces it from the 
  'shelf' above.
- Runes that have remained in the rune list for too long are replaced.


Advantages
- thematic: slots are no longer just ui elements, crystals create stones (makes sense)
- strategy: must commit to a spell (spend resources) before using it, allows opponent to 
            counter, can deny opponent from using certain spells by taking the corresponding runes before them but not needing to immediatly use them.
			Can see what runes will be available next and plan ahead.
			game
- gameplay: more spells (because of the changing rune list), better spells later in the
